Hi, Iâ€™m Bipul â€” a developer who loves building things with code.

This site is where I collect my personal projects, experiments, and ideas. Itâ€™s a bit of a digital playground.

## Fun Fact

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing guitar, hiking and reading lots of books. If Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably with my friends outside.
